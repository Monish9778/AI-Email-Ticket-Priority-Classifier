# AI Email / Ticket Priority Classifier

## Description
This project is an AI-based system that automatically identifies the priority
of incoming emails or support tickets.

In IT support environments, teams receive many messages daily and cannot
manually decide which issue is urgent. This system solves that problem by
analyzing the message content and assigning a priority level automatically.

## What This Project Does
- Reads email or ticket message text
- Understands the importance using AI (NLP)
- Classifies the message into a priority level

## Priority Levels
- High – Critical issues like server down, payment failure
- Medium – Login issues, account access problems
- Low – General queries or feature requests

## Why This Project Is Useful
- Saves manual effort for support teams
- Ensures critical issues are handled first
- Improves response time and customer satisfaction
- Suitable for real-world IT support systems

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning (NLP)
- FastAPI
- Scikit-learn
- SQLite

## Real-World Use Case
This system can be integrated with email platforms or helpdesk tools to
automatically prioritize support tickets before a human reads them.
